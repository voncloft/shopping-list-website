<br><U>Steps:</u> <br>Crust<br />
1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees.<br />
    <br />
2) Combine mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Take out of microwave and mix. Microwave for another 30 seconds and mix again.<br />
    <br />
3) Add almond flour, baking powder, egg, and any herbs and spices to the melted mixture. Mix all the ingredients together with a fork until they combine and begin to cool. Then knead by hand and form into a pizza crust on a nonstick pan. (We like to place parchment paper over the crust and roll with a rolling pin. It can be tough to shape by hand.)<br />
    <br />
4) Bake for 10-12 minutes at 425 degrees. Remove from the oven, add desired toppings and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes.<br />
